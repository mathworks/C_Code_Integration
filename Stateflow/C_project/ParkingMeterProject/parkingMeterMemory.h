* Shared memory access file

*          The access in read and writes modes is done via a dynamically
*          allocated shared memory that allows the graphical App to communicate
*          with the C console program.
*          This file must be included in the C console program to have the full
*          system working properly: #include "ParkingMeterMemory.h"
