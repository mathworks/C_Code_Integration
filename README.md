# **C Code Integration in MATLAB and Simulink to Control an External Interface**
This example is focusing on the integration of C code in MATLAB and Simulink.

## **Overview**

***Goal***: Show C code integration and C code generation out of MATLAB and Simulink algorithms for a parking meter application

***Technique 1***: MATLAB implementation with or without Stateflow and also with or without the App Designer

***Technique 2***: Simulink implementation with or without System Composer

***End result***: In all cases, the goal is first to be able to simulate the entire system by integrating the low-level C interface drivers and then to generate C code out of the algorithm and create a standalone executable automatically

***Data used***: PNG images have been created to graphically design the parking meter application

***MATLAB Project***: ParkingMeter.prj

***MATLAB App***: ParkingMeterGUI.mlapp

## **Steps**

**Step 1**: To setup the project in MATLAB, double click on "ParkingMeter.prj"

**Step 2**: In the "project shortcut" tab on top, click on the option of your choice to either simulate/generate or run the code.
The contents of the "project shortcut" tab depends on the selected implementation

**Step 3**: Each local "Readme.txt" file provides the needed steps to do to properly run the application

## **Summary**
A C# interface is used for the front-end of the parking meter and it can be controlled with MATLAB and Simulink through a Windows shared memory interface
